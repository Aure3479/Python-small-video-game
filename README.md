# Python small video game
 Small python game  using pygame to learn user study

Launch the game to defend yourself against zombies appearing to the sound of the beat you have chosen 
You have one life , if a zombie touches you it's game over.
But the closer you kill them the more points you get. 
You can use an arduino board with a button matrix to play or the directional arrows to defend yourself.

For a user study we load all the different kinds of data at the end of a player's run. 
As long as the same user uses the same player name , the corresponding csv file of the player will be updated. 

When you chose the music and put in a username the game will take some time to load the corresponding music.
